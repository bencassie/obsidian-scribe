## Who is this for?

| If you use... | You'll love this because... |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** | Finally query your vault's graph structure from the command line |
| **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** | Purpose-built plugin with 33 skills + 5 hooks + 8 agents for knowledge management |
| **RAG systems** | Graph-first beats chunk-based retrieval for PKM (see below) |
| **[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)** | [smoking-mirror](https://github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror) is a production MCP server for Obsidian |

## Why Not RAG?

[RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is the standard approach for AI + knowledge bases. But for [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), it has fundamental limitations:

| RAG Approach | Graph-First Approach |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Embed chunks → retrieve similar | Query relationships → understand structure |
| "Here are 10 similar paragraphs" | "Here's how these 3 notes connect to 12 others" |
| Static retrieval | Interactive REPL loop |
| Read-only | Read, write, and automate |
| No understanding of links | Full backlink/forward link awareness |
| Chunks lose context | Graph preserves relationships |

**The [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) REPL loop changes everything.** It's not retrieval—it's a conversation with your knowledge graph. Ask a question, get an answer, ask a follow-up, take action, all in one session.

---

## The Problem with File-Centric AI

Traditional AI tools (including RAG) read your vault file-by-file:
- 50 files × 1000 tokens = 50K tokens consumed
- Shallow understanding—no relationships
- Can't see the graph structure
- Can't take action on what it finds

**Obsidian Scribe + [smoking-mirror](https://github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror) is different.** It treats your vault as a **queryable knowledge graph**.

---

## The Solution: Graph-First Navigation

Obsidian Scribe + [smoking-mirror MCP](https://github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror) treats your vault as a **knowledge graph**, not a file system.

```
OLD WAY (file-centric):
  User: "Find notes about Project Alpha"
  Claude: Grep → 47 matches → Read all files → 50K+ tokens
          Manual synthesis, no relationships

NEW WAY (graph-first):
  User: "Find notes about Project Alpha"
  Claude: search_notes(title_contains="Project Alpha") → 3 core notes
          get_backlinks() → 12 notes that reference it
          get_unlinked_mentions() → 8 linking opportunities
          Surgically read 3 notes → 5K tokens
          Deep understanding with connections
```

> **[smoking-mirror](https://github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror) gives Claude the map, not the territory.**

---

## The Three-Layer Architecture

```
YOUR EYES (smoking-mirror MCP)
  - Navigate: Where are things?
  - Discover: What exists?
  - Understand: How do things relate?
  ↓
YOUR BRAIN (obsidian-scribe skills)
  - Execute workflows
  - Maintain vault health
  - Automate patterns
  ↓
YOUR HANDS (Read/Edit/Write)
  - Read content
  - Edit text
  - Write files
```

**Use your eyes to see where to go. Only use your hands when you know what to touch.**

---

## Privacy by Design

[smoking-mirror](https://github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror) was built with a core principle: **your content never leaves your machine**.

```
    YOUR MACHINE                           │    CLOUD
    ────────────────────────────────────── │ ────────────────
                                           │

    │   Obsidian      │                    │

    └────────┬────────┘                    │
             │                             │

    └─────────────────┘  (paths, links,   └─────────────────┘
                          tags only)
```

**What Claude receives**: File paths, link relationships, tags, frontmatter keys, word counts, dates.

**What Claude NEVER receives**: Your actual note content—unless you explicitly `Read` it.

> Your vault's secrets stay yours. Claude sees only what it needs.

---

## Token Economy

Every character Claude reads costs tokens. [smoking-mirror](https://github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror) changes the math:

| Approach | Query | Tokens | Cost |
|----------|-------|--------|------|
| **Traditional** | "Read all notes with #project tag" | ~100,000 | ~$0.30 |
| **smoking-mirror** | `search_notes({ has_tag: "project" })` | ~500 | ~$0.0015 |

**200x savings per query.** Then Claude surgically reads only the 2-3 notes it actually needs.

---

## Performance

| Vault Size | Index Build | Query Time | Memory |
|------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 100 notes | <200ms | <10ms | ~20MB |
| 500 notes | <500ms | <10ms | ~30MB |
| 1,500 notes | <2s | <10ms | ~50MB |
| 5,000 notes | <5s | <10ms | ~100MB |

Queries hit an in-memory index, not your filesystem. Instant results.

---

## What You Get

| Layer | Component | What It Provides |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| **Intelligence** | [smoking-mirror](https://github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror) MCP | 47 graph tools: backlinks, hubs, orphans, link paths, sections, frontmatter, tasks |
| **Workflows** | 35 obsidian-scribe skills | Daily logging, vault health, rollups, wikilink automation, graph analysis |
| **Automation** | 4 smart hooks | Achievement detection, wikilink suggestions, syntax validation |
| **Agents** | 8 intelligent agents | Rollup summaries, schema enforcement, relationship exploration, achievements |

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

In Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add bencassie/obsidian-scribe
/plugin install obsidian-scribe@bencassie/obsidian-scribe
```

Or use the interactive UI: `/plugin` → Discover → obsidian-scribe → Install

### Step 2: Configure smoking-mirror MCP

Create `.mcp.json` in your vault root:

**WSL / macOS / Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smoking-mirror": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "smoking-mirror@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH": "/mnt/c/Users/you/obsidian/vault"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows (native):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smoking-mirror": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "smoking-mirror@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH": "C:/Users/you/obsidian/vault"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Platform | Command | Path Format |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| WSL/Linux/macOS | `"command": "npx"` | `/mnt/c/...` or `/home/...` |
| Windows | `"command": "cmd"` with `"/c", "npx"` args | `C:/Users/...` (forward slashes) |

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
cd /path/to/your/vault
claude

# Natural language:
> How's my vault looking?

# Or slash commands:
> /vault-health
```

## smoking-mirror: Your Eyes

The power of this product comes from [**smoking-mirror MCP**](https://github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror). It turns your vault into a queryable graph with **47 tools** across 8 categories.

> **"tezcatl"** (Nahuatl) literally means "smoking mirror"—the original name for obsidian.
> The mirror reveals structure without taking content.

**GitHub**: [github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror](https://github.com/bencassie/smoking-mirror)

### The Token Economy

Every character Claude reads costs tokens. smoking-mirror changes the math:

```
BEFORE (file-centric):
  You: "Find notes about React"
  Claude: grep → 47 matches → read all files → 50,000+ tokens

AFTER (graph-first):
  You: "Find notes about React"
  Claude: search_notes() → 3 core notes
          get_backlinks() → 12 references
          Read only 3 files → 5,000 tokens
```

**Result**: 90% token reduction, 10x faster, deeper understanding through relationships.

## Intelligent Agents (8 Agents)

Agents are autonomous workflows that Claude orchestrates using natural language. Just describe what you want—Claude invokes the right agent with the right tools.

### The Power of Natural Language Workflows

Instead of remembering commands, just ask:

```
You: "How do my project notes relate to my tech notes?"

Claude: [Invokes relationship-explorer agent]
        [Agent calls get_connection_strength, get_link_path, get_common_neighbors]
        [Returns comprehensive relationship report]

You: "My frontmatter is a mess. Can you audit it?"

Claude: [Invokes schema-enforcer agent]
        [Agent calls get_frontmatter_schema, find_frontmatter_inconsistencies]
        [Returns schema report with fix suggestions]

You: "Fix the tags field inconsistency"

Claude: [Schema-enforcer agent applies fixes with your confirmation]
```

This is the Claude Code REPL advantage: **conversation-driven automation**.

### Rollup Agents (5 agents) — Create Summary Notes

| Agent | What You Get | Changes Files? |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Daily Rollup** | Extracts highlights from today's daily note | **Yes** - Creates summary |
| **Weekly Rollup** | Synthesizes week from daily notes | **Yes** - Creates `weekly-notes/YYYY-WNN.md` |
| **Monthly Rollup** | Synthesizes month from weekly notes | **Yes** - Creates `monthly-notes/YYYY-MM.md` |
| **Quarterly Rollup** | Synthesizes quarter from monthly notes | **Yes** - Creates `quarterly-notes/YYYY-QN.md` |
| **Yearly Rollup** | Synthesizes year from quarterly notes | **Yes** - Creates `yearly-notes/YYYY.md` |

**How it works**: Each rollup agent reads the previous tier's notes and creates structured summaries. Daily → Weekly → Monthly → Quarterly → Yearly.

### Analysis Agents (3 agents)

| Agent | What You Get | Changes Files? |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Achievement Extractor** | Finds accomplishments in your logs (126 patterns) | **Yes** - Updates `Achievements.md` |
| **Schema Enforcer** | Audits frontmatter, suggests fixes, applies corrections | **Optional** - Fixes with confirmation |
| **Relationship Explorer** | Deep relationship analysis between notes | **No** - Read-only reports |

### Schema Enforcer Agent

**What it does**: Analyzes your vault's frontmatter schema, detects inconsistencies (e.g., `tags: "work"` vs `tags: ["work"]`), and optionally fixes them.

**User outcomes**:
- **Audit mode** (default): Get a report of schema problems. Nothing changes.
- **Fix mode**: Agent applies fixes **with your confirmation**. You approve each change.

**Example conversation**:
```
You: "Check my vault's frontmatter schema"
Claude: [Runs audit, returns report]

        Schema Report:
        - 'tags' field: 12 notes use string instead of array
        - 'priority' field: 5 notes use quoted numbers

        Would you like me to fix these?

You: "Yes, fix the tags field"
Claude: [Applies fixes with confirmation for each file]
```

### Relationship Explorer Agent

**What it does**: Deep-dives into how two notes relate using multiple graph metrics.

**User outcomes**: A comprehensive report including:
- Connection strength score (0-100)
- Link path (A → B → C)
- Common neighbors (shared references)
- Bidirectional link check
- Relationship narrative

**This agent is READ-ONLY**. It never modifies your vault—only analyzes and reports.

**Example conversation**:
```
You: "How does [[Project Alpha]] relate to [[React]]?"
Claude: [Runs relationship analysis]

        Connection Strength: 78/100 (Strong)
        Path: Project Alpha → React (direct link)
        Common Neighbors: TypeScript, Node.js, Testing
        Bidirectional: Yes (both link to each other)

        Narrative: React is a core dependency of Project Alpha,
        explicitly documented in the tech stack section.
```

## Smart Hooks

These run automatically:

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `session-start` | Session start | Shows vault status, recent achievements |
| `achievement-detect` | After edits | Detects wins from logs (126 patterns) |
| `wikilink-suggest` | After edits | Auto-applies wikilinks to known entities |
| `syntax-validate` | After edits | Warns about syntax issues |

### Achievement Detection

The achievement hook watches for patterns like:
- **Actions**: Built, created, deployed, fixed, shipped
- **Progress**: Completed, finished, launched
- **Success signals**: Works, passed, all tests green
- **Milestones**: v1.0, first time, breakthrough
- **Bold text**: `**Anything in bold**` = important
- **Emojis**: ✅ 🎉 🚀 💪 🏆

When detected, achievements auto-add to your `Achievements.md` for performance reviews.

### The REPL Advantage

[RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) is one-shot: embed → retrieve → answer → done.

[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) is a **conversation**:
```
You: What do I know about authentication?
     [Claude queries graph, reads 3 notes]

You: How does that connect to the API project?
     [Claude follows links, finds 5 related notes]

You: Create a summary note linking these together
     [Claude writes new note with proper wikilinks]

You: Add it to my weekly rollup
     [Claude updates weekly note]
```

One session. Full context. Actions taken. That's the power of graph-first + REPL.
